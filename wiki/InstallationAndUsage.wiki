There is a property file that comes along with it. 'cobertura.properties'. This property file needs to be modified to match your local folder structure,war file name, etc.


== 1. Instrument ==
This step takes a war file as input and will then generate a war file instrumented with Cobertura.

*Input* : War file to be instrumented
*Output*: Instrumented war file
          .ser file generated by Cobertura

== 2. Test the application ==
In this step, test the application by running manual tests or automated tests.
The .ser file generated during the instrumentation phase *must* be put in the tomcat\bin folder. Otherwise A new .ser file will be created which will then generate *zero-coverage*  report

== 3. Generating report ==
