#summary Installation and usage instructions.

= Installation =

Do a SVN Checkout from https://cobertura-coverage-for-war.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

= What you need =

  * Ant
  * Groovy
  * War file to be instrumented

= Assumption =
  * Basic knowledge about how Cobertura works and what it means to instrument java byte code

= Usage =
This runs off an Ant script. SO each command is run as an ant command.

E.g. ant command

There is a property file that comes along with it. 'cobertura.properties'. This property file needs to be modified to match your local folder structure,war file name, etc.


== 1. Instrument ==
This step takes a war file as input and will then generate a war file instrumented with Cobertura. All the jar files in the war file will be instrumented (You can control what _not_ to instrument though)

*Input* : War file to be instrumented

*Output*: 
          # Instrumented war file
          # .ser file generated by Cobertura

*command*: ant instrument


== 2. Test the application ==
In this step, test the application by running manual tests or automated tests.
The .ser file generated during the instrumentation phase *must* be put in the tomcat\bin folder. Otherwise A new .ser file will be created which will then generate *zero-coverage*  report

== 3. Generating report ==
